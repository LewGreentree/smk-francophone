**smk-client** is designed to make it easy to integrate a map into a web application.

The application only needs to include one `<script>` tag to load the library, and define a single `<div>` tag to contain the map.
There is no other code for the application to write, the map functionality is defined completely by a JSON configuration structure.

Here is an example of a complete HTML page that uses smk-client to show a map:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title></title>
        <script src="smk.js" smk-container-sel="#smk-map-frame"></script>
        <style>
            #smk-map-frame { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0; }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body id="smk-map-frame"></body>
</html>
```

The [client API](https://bcgov.github.io/smk-client/SMK-Client-API) details how the application interacts with the map. 
The interaction is via attributes on the `<script>` tag, and/or parameters passed to the page in the URL.
There are [examples](https://bcgov.github.io/smk-client/SMK-Client-API-Examples) of the various ways the map can be configured.

The [configuration](https://bcgov.github.io/smk-client/SMK-Client-Configuration) controls all aspects of the map.

Creating the configuration by hand is tedious, for most uses it is easier to use the **smk-admin** tool.
The smk-admin tool lets you edit the configuration in an interactive UI, and lets you test the map in a demo application.
When you satisfied with the map, you can ask smk-admin to generate an export package that contains the smk-client library along with the configuration.
This export package can be easily integrated into an application.

See [EXPORT.md](EXPORT.md) for more information on working with export packages.

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for more information on doing development on smk-client.
